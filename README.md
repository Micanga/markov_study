# Worspace Info: markov_study
This workspace refers to my studies in Markov Decision Problems (MDPs).
Codes of MDPs and POMDPs are included for now solving the classic problem of "3x4 world".
Value-Iteration, Best-Policy, Expected-Utility and Policy-Evaluation algorithms are implemented too.
All codes are public and can be used for free for the right purpose.
Collaborations and tips are welcome too. 

Obrigado,
Matheus Alves.
